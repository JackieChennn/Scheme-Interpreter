# Scheme Interpreter

This is a Scheme Interpreter implemented by Jiacheng(Jackie) Chen using Python.

## About Scheme Interpreter

Scheme is a minimalist dialect of the Lisp programming language. It is known for its simplicity and powerful abstraction capabilities. This interpreter allows you to write and execute Scheme code using Python.

## Features

The Scheme Interpreter offers the following features:

- Evaluation of Scheme expressions
- Support for basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Definition of variables using `define`
- Creation of lambda functions using `lambda`
- Conditional expressions using `if`
- List manipulation functions such as `cons`, `car`, and `cdr`
- Recursive function calls
- Support for nested expressions and parentheses

## Usage

To use the Scheme Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JackieChennn/Scheme-Interpreter.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd scheme-interpreter`
4. Run the interpreter: `python3 .\scheme.py`
5. The interpreter will display a prompt where you can enter Scheme expressions.
6. Type your Scheme code and press Enter to evaluate it.
7. The result of the expression will be displayed.

Here's an example of using the Scheme Interpreter:
